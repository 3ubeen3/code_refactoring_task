1.  In the Booking Repository we should not call the constant directly from env file. Instead we should
retrieve from config file,i created file called it constants.php inside config folder. 

2.  We can remove unnecessary else statements for cleaner code example in BookingController we have code written in
distanceFeed method:
     Actual Code: 
        if (isset($data['distance']) && $data['distance'] != "") {
            $distance = $data['distance'];
        } else {
            $distance = "";
        }

      Refactor Code: 
         $distance = "";
          if (isset($data['distance']) && $data['distance'] != "") {
            $distance = $data['distance'];
          }
     We can remove same unnecceary else conditions everywhere in the code. 

3. We should remove all unused veriables inside code everywhere. e.g 
     BookingController:(resendSMSNotifications)
     we have unused veriable called $job_data.

4. I would like to write code for BookingRepository:storeJobEmail method something Like that 
       Refactor Code: 
       public function storeJobEmail($data)
            {
                $job = Job::findOrFail(@$data['user_email_job_id']);
                $job->user_email = @$data['user_email'];
                $job->reference = isset($data['reference']) ? $data['reference'] : '';
                $user = $job->user()->first();

                if (isset($data['address'])) {
                    $job->address = $data['address'] ?: $user->userMeta->address;
                    $job->instructions = $data['instructions'] ?: $user->userMeta->instructions;
                    $job->town = $data['town'] ?: $user->userMeta->city;
                }
                $job->save();

                $email = $job->user_email ?: $user->email;
                $name = $user->name;
                $subject = 'Vi har mottagit er tolkbokning. Bokningsnr: #' . $job->id;
                $send_data = [
                    'user' => $user,
                    'job'  => $job
                ];
                $this->mailer->send($email, $name, $subject, 'emails.job-created', $send_data);

                $response = [
                    'type' => $data['user_type'],
                    'job' => $job,
                    'status' => 'success'
                ];
                $data = $this->jobToData($job);
                Event::fire(new JobWasCreated($job, $data, '*'));
                return $response;
            }

        Here What i Did: 
        - Replaced the use of get()->first() with first() to simplify the code as there is no pupose for getting all records and then first one.
        - Used the null coalescing operator (??) to simplify the assignment of values to $job->address, $job->instructions, $job->town, and $email
        - Initialized the $response array using an array literal and added the $data['user_type'] value to it
        - Removed the unnecceary $response['job'] assignment since $job is already a variable in the function
        - Removed the unnecessary $response['status'] assignment
        - Moved the Event::fire() call to the end of the function

5.      In BookingRepository:getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId method I did the following changes which i think it should 
         be. Instead of filtering records in foreach loop we should use laravel collection filters which 
         are more readable,So i did 
         - Replaced the $job_ids array with a $jobs collection, which is the result of the getJobs() function
         - Used an if/elseif/else statement to determine the value of $job_type based on the value of $translator_type
         - Used the pluck() and all() methods to simplify the assignment of the $languages variable
         - Used the filter() method to filter the jobs based on the specified conditions, instead of using a foreach loop
         - Removed the unnecessary $k and $v variables in the foreach loop
         - Changed the name of the $job_ids variable to $filtered_jobs to reflect its new purpose
         - Moved the call to TeHelper::convertJobIdsInObjs() outside of the foreach loop
         - Replaced the unset() function with the filter() method to remove unwanted jobs from the collection

6.  In our code we are calling Database Quries inside the loop which is not good and can cause many issues with database performance 
       We should avoid queries in a loop instead we should first filter the record and apply apply single query for all records, 
       
7.  In BookingRepositry:SendNotificationTransaltors i did the changes : 
     - Replaced the $translator_array and $delpay_translator_array arrays with a single $suitable_translators collection
     - Used a single where() chain to filter the users based on the specified conditions, instead of using a foreach loop
     - Removed the $oneUser and $oneJob variables, as they are not used
     - Removed the getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId() function call and the inner foreach loop, as it is not needed to filter the suitable translators       


8.   In my opinion, We should use write classes and functions which are responsible for only 1 task, for example
      SendEmailClass should only be responsible for sending email to the recipient it should not validate email or
      should not do some other task, for validating the email there should be seperate request class ,in fact laravel provides us 
      the way we can validate the form requests inside seperate classes, 

9.   We should avoid to write business  logic inside controller it should be in service class, 

10.  We should avoid multiple if else conditions as the code becomes pain to debug.
11.  For database Queries we should retrieve the columns we need instead of selecting all the columns . 
     
I did some changes in code i mentioned above, I refactored some methods but of course we can apply same terms for everywhere in our code , 
Happy Coding,
Cheers
